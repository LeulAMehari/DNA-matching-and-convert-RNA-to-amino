# DNA-matching-and-convert-RNA-to-amino
This program takes an mRNA string as input and outputs a string of amino acids. The program also takes two DNA inputs and examines whether they match with their complementary base. If not, it saves it as a mutation and then outputs the match, mutation, and its RNA complement.
